	abstract = {The Open Unemployment Rate indicates the percentage of the labor force that is included in unemployment. The interpretation of a high Open Unemployment Rate indicates that there is a large number of workers who are not absorbed in the labor market. Thus, a prediction system for the Open Unemployment Rate in Indonesia is needed, to find out how much of the labor force is not absorbed in the labor market. So that the government in this case the Ministry of Manpower can anticipate by increasing job opportunities and employment opportunities for a productive workforce. In this study, a Deep Learning method is proposed to predict the Open Unemployment Rate in Indonesia. From the training stage, the success percentage is 97.93%, and the testing stage is 92.10%.  © 2022 IEEE.},
