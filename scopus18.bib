	abstract = {Cryptocurrency price fluctuations are increasingly interesting and are of concern to researchers around the world. Many ways have been proposed to predict the next price, whether it will go up or down. This research shows how to create a patterned dataset from an API connection shared by Indonesia's leading digital currency market, Indodax. From the data on the movement of all cryptocurrencies, the lowest price variable is taken for 24 hours, the latest price, the highest price for 24 hours, and the time of price movement, which is then programmed into a pattern dataset. This patterned dataset is then mined and stored continuously on the MySQL Server DBMS on the hosting service. The patterned dataset is then separated per month, and the data per day is calculated. The minimum, maximum, and average functions are then applied to form a graph that displays paired lines of the movement of the patterned dataset in Crash and Moon conditions. From the observations, the Patterned Graphical Pair dataset using the Average function provides the best potential for predicting future cryptocurrency price fluctuations with the Bitcoin case study. The novelty of this research is the development of patterned datasets for predicting cryptocurrency fluctuations based on the influence of bitcoin price movements on all currencies in the cryptocurrency trading market. This research also proved the truth of hypotheses a and b related to the start and end of fluctuations. © 2024, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved.},
