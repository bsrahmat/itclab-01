	abstract = {The design of the pond for intelligent koi fish farming system proposed in this paper. This pond is called Intelligent Fishcarelab System (IFS). IFS as fish farming system is Internet-based Remote using IDACS Technology (Internet-based Data Acquisition and Control System). IFS hardware consists of mechanical and electronic systems. Mechanical system consists of water tanks and piping systems. While the electronic system comprises sensors temperature and pH. These sensors include signal conditioning circuit. Furthermore, by using Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) module the data can be read by the microcontroller circuit. Microcontroller circuit is assigned to conduct sensor readings and sends data to the server to inform water conditions. Another electronic system used is the on/off electric valve. Several electronic faucets are also used and their workings are controlled by a microcontroller. With this faucet system, the water supply, as well as the disposal of fish pond water can be controlled electronically. Besides, the system is also equipped with an actuator module, which is used to regulate the temperature and pH in the water. Actuators are also used for fish feeding settings. The microcontroller control module requires Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) and signal conditioning circuit. IFS in the operating system hardware requires microcontroller-based software and web-based software for monitoring and controlling water quality and feeding automatically and scheduled. Furthermore, this system apart can work directly in the area of fish farming can also be monitored and controlled remotely using an Internet connection.},
