# iTCLab-01 Test

iTCLab - Internet-Based Temperature Control Lab. Temperature control kit for feedback control applications with an ESP32 Microcontroller, LED, two heaters, and two temperature sensors. The heating power output is adjusted to maintain the desired temperature setpoint. Heat energy from the heater is transferred by conduction, convection, and radiation to the temperature sensor. Heat is also transferred from the device to the environment.

About these iTCLab kits :
- It inspired TCLab Product BYU (Brigham Young University), one of the private campuses in Provo, Utah, United States of America.
- Miniature Control System in a Pocket.
- Practical IoT Learning Package Tools.
- IoT programming Kits.
- IoT-Based Control System Practice Devices.
- It can be used to learn System Dynamics and Control Systems.
- It can be used to learn Arduino and Python programming.
- It can be used to learn AI and Machine Learning Programming.
- And others.

The underlying difference between TCLab and BYU's TCLab product is replacing the Arduino Uno microcontroller with ESP32. Using this ESP32, iTCLab can connect to the Internet of Things (IoT).
