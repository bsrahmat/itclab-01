	abstract = {The process of loading and unloading containers at the port is very important to be automated in order to increase productivity, revenues, efficiency and safety in the logistics transportation process especially in a maritime country like Indonesia. To achieve this, identification and tracking of container positions need to be done accurately so that container transfers can occur precisely and smoothly. In this study, YOLO deep learning is used to detect moving containers. The model is trained using container images, and then the validation and testing process are carried out on the model using other container images. The results of training are stored in several checkpoints which will be compared to get the most accurate model. Obtained YOLO gave good results for tracking containers with MAP value of 68.63% and LAMR of 0.31. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},
