	abstract = {Due to high vehicle mobility, sporadic connectivity, and fluctuating network circumstances, traditional communication infrastructures sometimes find it difficult to meet the demands of Smart City applications. In this context, Vehicular Delay Tolerant Networks (VDTNs) have emerged as a promising communication paradigm to address the unique challenges of vehicular environments in Smart Cities. The motivation behind this research stems from the critical need for efficient, low-cost and reliable communication in Smart Cities. This paper aims to implement VDTN and assess the process of message replication on spray routers within the context of the Surabaya Smart City scenario namely SNHDv1, SNHDv2, and SNW. The scenario is simulated using The Opportunistic Network Environment Simulator. Simulation results show that SNHD V2 demonstrated superior performance in comparison to both SNHD V1 and SNW. The message delivery ratio of SNHD v2 has a positive correlation with the number of message replications. On the other hand, SNHDv2 exhibits the highest average message delivery latency compared to the other two routing protocols, despite an increase in the number of message replications. SNHDv2 demonstrates the ability to maintain an overhead ratio of up to 40 messages, even with a 400% increase in replications. The assessment results presented in this work can serve as a valuable contribution to the advancement of buffer management and message scheduling techniques for smart cities in future research. © 2023 IEEE.},
