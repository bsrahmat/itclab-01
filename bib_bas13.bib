	abstract = {The Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) flow turbulence analysis aims to increase the dissolved oxygen (DO) in wastewater. This DO is a significant factor that influences the abundance of microbes in SBR. These microbes act as wastewater pollutants degraders in the SBR. The other problem of SBR, the sludge is frequently included in the effluent, reducing the quality of the treated wastewater. As a result, the aim of this study is to examine the effects of turbulence in square-cylindrical SBRs, as well as the effects of adding a sludge zone at the bottom of the SBR. This research is divided into two activities, turbulence analysis using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and laboratory scale design of an SBR prototype complete with impeller. On a laboratory scale, the variables used are hydraulic retention time and impeller rotation speed of 50 and 150 rpm. The experiment results showed that a rectangular-shaped SBR with a sludge zone could achieve an optimal DO of 4.04 mg/L. CFD modelling resulted in similar results; flow turbulence was evenly distributed throughout the reactor, increasing the DO content. © 2023 IEEE.},
