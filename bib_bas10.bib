	abstract = {Vehicle License Plate Images Segmentation is a substantial stage for developing an Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) system. In this paper, it is considered an efficient segmentation algorithm for extracting vehicle license plate images using Cellular Neural Networks (CNN). The learning CNN templates values are formulated as an optimization problem to achieve the desired performances which can be found by means of Adaptive Fuzzy (AF) algorithm and Neuro-Fuzzy (NF) algorithm techniques. The main objective of the paper is to compare the performances of standard CNN, Adaptive Fuzzy (AF), and Neuro-Fuzzy (NF) on real data of several vehicle license plate images of standard Indonesia License Plates. The results are then compared with ideal vehicle license plate images. Quantitative analysis between ideal vehicle license plate images and segmented vehicle license plate images is presented in terms of Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). From the performance analysis, the CNN template optimized by ANFIS algorithm is more recommended than the standard CNN edge detector or the CNN template optimized by Adaptive Fuzzy algorithm in vehicle license plate image segmentation. It is shown from the calculation that PSNR is 80% better than the standard CNN, and the resulted MSE and RMSE are 70% better than the standard CNN. Whereas the CNN template optimized by Adaptive Fuzzy algorithm achieves the PSNR 90% better than the standard CNN, but it yields the MSE and RMSE 40% worse than the standard CNN. © 2016 SERSC.},
