	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach for tuning Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers using deep learning techniques, specifically applied to the iTCLab, an advanced industrial control laboratory system. PID controllers are widely used in industrial processes for their simplicity and effectiveness. However, their performance heavily relies on proper tuning, which can be a complex and time-consuming task. In this study, we leverage the capabilities of deep learning to automate and optimize the PID tuning process for the iTCLab setup. We propose a data-driven methodology that combines system identification, Deep Learning networks, and optimization algorithms to achieve superior PID controller tuning. © 2023 IEEE.},
