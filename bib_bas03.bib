	abstract = {In this paper, a widely developed learning machine algorithm called Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is used to recognize Indonesia vehicle license plates. The algorithm includes grayscale, binary, erosion, dilation and convolution processes, as well as the process of smearing, location determination and character segmentation before the ELM algorithm is applied. The algorithm includes one crucial and rarely performed technique for extraction of vehicle license plates, namely Smearing Algorithms. In the experimental results, ELM is compared with the template matching method. The obtained outcome of the average accuracy of both methods has the same value of 70.3175%. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.},
